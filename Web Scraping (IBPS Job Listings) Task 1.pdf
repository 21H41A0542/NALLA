Pinak Venture – Demo Task Instructions
Task 1 – Web Scraping (IBPS Job Listings)
Goal: Write a Python script to scrape public IBPS job listings from the official website and extract the following fields:
• Job Title
• Location
• Post/Publish Date
• Link to detailed job page

The results must be saved into a CSV file using Pandas.
Steps to Follow:
1. Create a project folder and install dependencies:
•	mkdir ibps_scraper
cd ibps_scraper
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
2. Visit the IBPS official site: https://www.ibps.in/
Explore the 'Recruitment Process' or 'Career' section for job listings.
3. Create the script file scrape_ibps_jobs.py with the following code:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

URL = "https://www.ibps.in/recruitment-process/"
response = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

jobs = []

for link in soup.select('a'):
    title = link.get_text(strip=True)
    href = link.get('href')

    if "recruitment" in title.lower() or "notification" in title.lower():
        jobs.append({
            "Job Title": title,
            "Location": "India",
            "Post/Publish Date": "N/A",
            "Link": href if href.startswith("http") else f"https://www.ibps.in/{href}"
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(jobs)
df.to_csv("ibps_jobs.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Scraping completed. File saved as ibps_jobs.csv")
4. Run the script: python scrape_ibps_jobs.py
Check that the CSV file is created and contains job listings.
